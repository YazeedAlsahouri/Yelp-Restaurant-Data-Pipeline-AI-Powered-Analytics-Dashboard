# Yelp-Restaurant-Data-Pipeline-AI-Powered-Analytics-Dashboard

This project delivers a robust, end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution designed to extract, store, analyze, and visualize restaurant data and customer reviews from Yelp. Beyond basic data collection, it integrates advanced techniques like dynamic proxy management for resilient scraping and Large Language Model (LLM) powered summarization to distill insights from customer feedback. The entire system is orchestrated through a Python-based pipeline and presented via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
